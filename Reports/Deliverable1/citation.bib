@electronic{citeulike:XuSimple,
    abstract = {In this paper, we try to further demonstrate that the models of random CSP
instances proposed by [Xu and Li, 2000; 2003] are of theoretical and practical
interest. Indeed, these models, called RB and RD, present several nice
features. First, it is quite easy to generate random instances of any arity
since no particular structure has to be integrated, or property enforced, in
such instances. Then, the existence of an asymptotic phase transition can be
guaranteed while applying a limited restriction on domain size and on
constraint tightness. In that case, a threshold point can be precisely located
and all instances have the guarantee to be hard at the threshold, i.e., to have
an exponential tree-resolution complexity. Next, a formal analysis shows that
it is possible to generate forced satisfiable instances whose hardness is
similar to unforced satisfiable ones. This analysis is supported by some
representative results taken from an intensive experimentation that we have
carried out, using complete and incomplete search methods.},

    abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be \&ldquo;reduced\&rdquo; to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here \&ldquo;reduced\&rdquo; means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

The presentation is remarkably clear; for example, the "proof idea," which offers the reader an intuitive feel for how the proof was constructed, accompanies many of the theorems and a proof. <I>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</I> covers the usual topics for this type of text plus it features a solid section on complexity theory--including an entire chapter on space complexity. The final chapter introduces more advanced topics, such as the discussion of complexity classes associated with probabilistic algorithms.} {This highly anticipated revision builds upon the strengths of the previous edition. Sipser's candid, crystal-clear style allows students at every level to understand and enjoy this field.}},

Two genetic algorithms were used:one allowed branching in the antenna arms and theother did not. The highest performance antennas fromboth algorithms were fabricated and tested. A hand-designedantenna was produced by the contractor responsiblefor the design and build of the mission antennas.The hand-designed antenna is a quadrifilar helix, and we present performance data for comparisonto the evolved antennas. As of this writing, one of ourevolved antenna prototypes is undergoing flight qualification testing. If successful, the resulting antennawould represent the first evolved hardware in space, andthe first deployed evolved antenna.},

    abstract = {Reliable vision-based control of an autonomous vehicle requires the ability to focus attention on the important features in an input scene. Previous work with an autonomous lane following system, ALVINN (Pomerleau, 1993), has yielded good results in uncluttered conditions. This paper presents an artificial neural network based learning approach for handling difficult scenes which will confuse the ALVINN system. This work presents a mechanism for achieving task-specific focus of attention by exploiting temporal coherence. A saliency map, which is based upon a computed expectation of the contents of the inputs in the next time step, indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map can be used to accentuate the features which are important for the task, and de-emphasize those which are not.},
